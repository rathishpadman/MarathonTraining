# Marathon Training Dashboard - Race Predictor System

## How the Race Predictor Works

The race prediction system uses proven scientific algorithms to analyze your authentic Strava training data and predict race performance with high accuracy.

### Core Algorithm: VDOT System

The predictor is built on Jack Daniels' **VDOT (VO2 max)** methodology, which has been validated by decades of elite coaching:

1. **Pace Analysis**: Analyzes your recent running paces from authentic Strava activities
2. **VDOT Calculation**: Converts your best performances into a VDOT score (aerobic capacity indicator)
3. **Race Equivalency**: Uses McMillan and Daniels' equivalent performance tables to predict times across all distances

### Your Current Data Analysis

Based on Rathish Padman's authentic Strava data:
- **Training Volume**: 94.62km over recent activities
- **Fitness Score**: 96.1/100 (exceptional fitness level)
- **Consistency**: 89.1% training consistency
- **Heart Rate Average**: 149.7 bpm
- **Average Pace**: 7:15 min/km

### Prediction Accuracy

**Current Predictions from Your Data:**
- **Half Marathon**: 2:16:11 (71.9% confidence)
- **5K**: 30:07 (72.7% confidence)

**Confidence Factors:**
- Training consistency over 30+ days
- Variety of running paces analyzed
- Heart rate data validation
- Recent activity frequency

### Scientific Methodology

#### 1. Data Collection
- Fetches authentic activities from Strava API
- Analyzes pace, distance, heart rate, elevation
- Filters for quality running data (excludes walks, incomplete activities)

#### 2. VDOT Calculation
```
VDOT = -4.6 + 0.182258 × (velocity_in_m_per_min) + 0.000104 × (velocity_in_m_per_min)²
```
Where velocity is calculated from your best recent performances.

#### 3. Race Time Prediction
Uses established pace equivalency tables:
- **5K to Marathon ratios** based on physiological research
- **Aerobic vs Anaerobic contributions** for different distances
- **Fatigue factors** for longer distances

#### 4. Confidence Scoring
Considers multiple factors:
- **Data Quality**: More recent data = higher confidence
- **Training Consistency**: Regular training = better predictions
- **Pace Variety**: Different paces = more accurate VDOT
- **Volume Adequacy**: Sufficient training for target distance

### Training Recommendations

The system provides personalized advice based on your current fitness:

1. **Zone-based Training**: Recommends easy, tempo, and interval paces
2. **Volume Guidance**: Suggests weekly mileage increases
3. **Race Pacing**: Optimal pacing strategy for target races
4. **Recovery Recommendations**: Based on training load analysis
