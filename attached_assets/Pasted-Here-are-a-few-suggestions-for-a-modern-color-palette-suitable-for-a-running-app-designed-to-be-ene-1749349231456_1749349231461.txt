Tips for Implementation:
Consistency: Apply your chosen palette consistently across all elements: text, backgrounds, buttons, charts, and icons.
Contrast: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors for readability, especially for dashboard data.
Semantic Use: Use colors semantically (e.g., green for positive trends, red for negative, blue for general information).
Chart Readability: For charts, use variations of your primary and secondary accents, or a sequential color scheme that fits the palette, ensuring different data series are distinguishable.
Dark Mode (Future): Consider how your palette might adapt to a dark mode theme if that's a future enhancement.
