Objective: Thoroughly debug the Marathon Training Dashboard application to identify and resolve issues causing blank/empty dashboard pages, missing insights, and empty charts for both the community overview and individual athlete dashboards. The goal is to ensure data is correctly processed, transferred from Flask to Streamlit, and visually rendered.

Initial Assessment & Debugging Focus Areas:

Database & Data Ingestion (Flask Backend - app/models.py, app/data_processor.py, app/routes.py):

Verify Data Presence: Check if the database (marathon.db if SQLite, or PostgreSQL) actually contains data in the Activity, DailySummary, PlannedWorkout, and ReplitAthlete tables.
How can we query the database directly from the Replit shell (e.g., using sqlite3 command or psql) to inspect table contents?
If the database is empty, identify why activities are not being fetched from Strava and saved. Debug app/strava_client.py (get_activities) and the part of the code that calls it (e.g., app/processing_workflows.py). Are there authentication errors (tokens, refresh_token issues) preventing data retrieval?
Data Processing Logic:
Step through app/data_processor.py (process_athlete_daily_performance, get_athlete_performance_summary, get_team_overview). Are these functions receiving valid input? Are they performing calculations as expected?
Inspect the output of process_athlete_daily_performance â€“ is it correctly creating/updating DailySummary records?
Review app/services/analytics.py (ReplitAnalyticsEngine): Is load_lightweight_models correctly loading models (even if placeholders for now)? Are get_sampled_training_data and predict_race_performance returning meaningful (even dummy) values?
Flask API Endpoints (Flask Backend - app/routes.py):

API Responsiveness:
Can we directly test the Flask API endpoints (e.g., /api/athletes, /api/athlete/<int:athlete_id>/dashboard-data, /api/realtime-dashboard) using curl from the Replit shell or by navigating to them in the Replit web browser?
What is the exact JSON response from these endpoints? If they return empty arrays or 500 errors, this is the root cause.
Data Serialization:
Are Flask-RESTx models or Marshmallow schemas correctly serializing the SQLAlchemy query results into JSON? Debug the serialization process if data is present in the database but not in the API response.
Error Handling & Logging:
Crucially, review the Flask application logs (in the Replit console). Are there any ERROR or WARNING messages from the API endpoints, database interactions, or data_processor indicating uncaught exceptions or failed queries? Utilize the athlete_id in logs to pinpoint athlete-specific issues.
Streamlit Frontend Data Consumption (dashboard/api_client.py, dashboard/streamlit_app.py):

API Calls from Streamlit:
Add print() statements or st.write() calls in dashboard/api_client.py to display the raw JSON responses received from the Flask backend. Is get_athlete_list_from_api() returning the expected list of athletes? Is get_athlete_dashboard_data() returning detailed performance data?
Check for network errors or requests exceptions when Streamlit tries to connect to Flask. (e.g., Flask server not running, incorrect URL).
Session State & Data Passing:
If data is fetched, ensure it's correctly stored in st.session_state and passed to display functions.
Real-time Updates (WebSockets):
Debug the WebSocket connection in dashboard/streamlit_app.py. Is it establishing a connection? Is it receiving dashboard_refresh events? Add client-side logging for WebSocket events.
Streamlit Frontend Rendering (dashboard/streamlit_app.py, dashboard/analytics_display.py):

Conditional Rendering:
Are the if selected_athlete == "Team Overview": and else: blocks correctly executed?
Are the st.markdown("replit-card glass-container") components actually populated with data?
Chart Data:
When st.line_chart or st.bar_chart are called, inspect the pandas DataFrames being passed to them. Use st.dataframe() or st.write() to display the DataFrame just before the chart call. Is the DataFrame populated with valid numerical data? If it's empty or contains NaNs, the chart will be blank.
CSS/Styling Issues:
While less likely to cause blank dashboards, check the Glassmorphism CSS. Ensure no CSS errors are hiding content.
Debugging Output Request:

For each identified issue, provide:

The problematic code snippet.
The observed error message or unexpected behavior.
The proposed fix with a detailed explanation of why it resolves the issue.
Log outputs (from both Flask and Streamlit if applicable) that support the diagnosis.
Specific Code Inspection Points:

main.py: Verify both Flask and Streamlit processes are starting correctly and not immediately crashing. Check the time.sleep duration.
app/__init__.py: Confirm db.create_all() is called within an app context. Check app.config for DATABASE_URL validity.
app/routes.py: Ensure all API routes have proper method decorators (@auth_ns.route(...).get, .post, etc.) and error handling.
app/models.py: Review column types, especially for JSONB (or Text for SQLite) fields, to ensure data can be stored.
app/data_processor.py: Verify data transformations and aggregations produce valid numerical data for charting.
dashboard/streamlit_app.py: Check st.sidebar.selectbox options and ensure they correctly map to athlete IDs.
requirements.txt: Confirm all dependencies (especially pandas, sqlalchemy, streamlit, flask-restx, flask-socketio, stravalib) are present and compatible versions.
Modern App Dashboard UI/UX & Data Insights
A modern marathon training dashboard should provide both high-level community insights and deep-dive individual metrics, presented clearly and visually.

1. Community/Overall Summary Dashboard (for 100+ Athletes):

Key Metrics:
Total Community Mileage/Duration: Sum of all activities for a selected period (e.g., last week, last month).
Average Pacing: Community-wide average pace for runs.
Top Performers: Leaderboards for total distance, fastest pace (e.g., per mile/km), or longest single activity.
Training Load Distribution: A chart showing how many athletes are in "low," "moderate," or "high" training load zones.
Injury Trends: If tracked, showing overall injury rates or common injury types across the community.
Participation Rate: How many athletes logged an activity in a given period.
Visualizations:
Large, bold KPI (Key Performance Indicator) cards for total mileage, average pace.
Bar charts for leaderboards.
Pie/Donut charts for training load distribution.
Line charts showing community-wide trends over time (e.g., average mileage per week).
Heatmap of popular training routes or times if location data is used.
2. Individual Athlete Dashboard:

"My Performance at a Glance" (Top Section):
Current Training Status: (e.g., "On Track," "Overreaching," "Under-trained") derived from DailySummary status.
Weekly/Monthly Progress: Total distance, duration, elevation gain for the current week/month vs. target.
Upcoming Workouts: List of next 3-5 PlannedWorkout entries with details (distance, pace, type).
Recent Notifications: Alerts for missed workouts, performance dips, or achievements.
Race Performance Prediction: (From ReplitAnalyticsEngine) Predicted time for an upcoming race based on training data.
Training Trends Over Time:
Mileage/Duration: Line chart showing daily/weekly mileage/duration with trend lines.
Pace: Line chart showing average pace trends for different run types (easy, tempo, long run).
Training Load: Chart visualizing accumulated training stress (e.g., ATL/CTL/TSB if calculated, or just total activity duration/intensity).
Heart Rate Zones: Distribution of time spent in different heart rate zones.
Specific Activity Details:
A table or list of recent activities, allowing drill-down to view details like map, splits, individual metrics.
Personal Bests & Records:
List of personal bests for various distances (1k, 5k, 10k, Half Marathon, Marathon).
Goal Tracking:
Progress bars or charts indicating how close the athlete is to their distance or race time goals.
Corresponding Data Needed:

Aggregated Data: DailySummary table (total distance, duration, calculated performance status, etc.), Activity table (raw activity details).
Goal Data: PlannedWorkout (targets), potentially a separate Goals table in models.py.
Analytics Data: Outputs from ReplitAnalyticsEngine (predictions, performance scores).
User Preferences: ReplitAthlete.preferences for notification settings, personalized goals.
